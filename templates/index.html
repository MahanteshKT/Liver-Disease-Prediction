                    <p>This is a blood test that measures the amount of a substance called bilirubin. This test is used to find out how well your liver is working. It is often part of a panel of tests that measure liver function. A small amount of bilirubin in your blood is normal, but a high level may be a sign of liver disease.</p>

                    <p>The ALP test may be done as part of a routine liver panel, a group of blood tests that looks at how well your liver is working.
                        ALP results are reported in units per liter (U/L). For men and women older than age 18, an ALP level between 44 and 147 U/L is considered normal. The normal range for children is higher than that for adults, especially for infants and teens because their bones are growing rapidly.

                        Results are given in units per liter (units/L). Normal ranges for AST are:Men: 14 to 20 units/L

                        Women: 10 to 36 units/L

                    <p>This test provides information about the amount of albumin you have compared with globulin. This comparison is called the A/G ratio. This test is useful when your healthcare provider suspects you have liver or kidney disease.
                        Certain diseases tend to lower your level of albumin and raise your level of one or more types of globulins. A normal range for total protein is 60 to 80 grams per liter (g/L). A normal range of albumin is 35 to 52 g/L. The normal range for globulins varies by specific type.
                        <br/>
                        If your protein level is low, you may have a liver or kidney problem.
                        <br/>
                        If your protein level is high, you may have a gastrointestinal problem.

                    <p>This test can help diagnose, evaluate, and watch kidney and liver conditions. When your kidneys start to fail, albumin starts to leak into your urine. This causes a low albumin level in your blood.
                      <br/>  Results are given in grams per deciliter (g/dL). A normal albumin range is 3.4 to 5.4 g/dL.

                        <br/>If you have a lower albumin level, you may have malnutrition. It can also mean that you have liver disease, kidney disease, or an inflammatory disease.  

                        <br/>Higher albumin levels may be caused by acute infections, burns, and stress from surgery or a heart attack.

                    Low or high A/G ratios can help your healthcare providers identify other health problems, including certain cancers, autoimmune diseases, or some genetic disorders.
